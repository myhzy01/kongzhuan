# Spatial_Glioma

This resource provides the R code to reproduce key results described in Greenwald, Galili Darnell, Hoefflin, et al. "Integrative spatial analysis reveals a multi-layered organization of glioblastoma".

The analyses are divided into 6 main modules:

Module 1: Per sample clustering, metaprogram generation, and spot annotation

Module 2: Spatial coherence and organizational zones

Module 3: Measures of spatial associations 

Module 4: defining consensus interactions

Module 5: Spatial CNA inference

Module 6: CODEX analysis

## Getting started
1. Clone Github repository.
2. Set the working directory to Inputs.
3. Download the data provided (Inputs.zip).
4. Run one of the 6 code modules in R.

## General notes

Please, note that due to the stochastic nature of random processes results of modules 3-4 might slightly differ dependending on the version of R/R packages used.

Each code module can be run independently.

The code uploaded here is the working code being used throughout the work on the project. We are currently working on generating a more user-friendly, readble and easy to run code. 

Requirements
R (tested in version 4.1.1).
